## Features

### Work Async
Assign Pipali a few tasks and go grab a coffee. Track progress, give feedback and get notified when Pipali needs your attention.

### Create polished deliverables
Turn messy inputs into shareable outputs — briefs, decision memos, project updates, meeting notes, and spreadsheets.

### Automate routine work
Set up tasks on a schedule or trigger them manually. "Draft my weekly project update email", "Sync my ledger on the 1st of every month", "Mark all marketing emails as spam".

### Teach it your workflows
Ask Pipali to create [skills](https://agentskills.io/) for all your custom workflows - where to find project documents, which accounting method to follow or your email organization policy.

### Connect your tools
Integrate Jira, Linear, Slack etc. via MCP. Pipali can create issues, post messages, and interact with external APIs on your behalf.

### Use your favorite AI models
Use the right AI model for the right task. Model access is provided through the Pipali Platform — Single Sign On, no API key setup needed.

### Run safely
Pipali runs commands safely in a local sandbox that restricts file and network access. This reduces your confirmation fatigue while it works safely on your computer.
Commands that need broader access require your explicit approval. You can configure these permissions yourself.
